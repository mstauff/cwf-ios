But we try to be smart about it so if we have an actual calling from LCR for a CTR7 teacher without a match in google drive, we would check to see if we have a potential calling in google drive for that same calling and individual (basically it was started in the app, but then recorded officially directly in LCR). If there's a match we update the potential with the actual. 
     
     As a general rule if there is an outstanding change that appears to be finalized in the LDS version, we don't delete, we mark it so the user can confirm deletion. The one pseudo-exception is a case where a calling had a potential change in the app, and then the LDS version has that change finalized. In that case we had an existing ID from LCR so we know it is a match and we don't really delete a record, we just remove the potential details. In other cases where there was a potential being considered (but didn't have an ID from LCR), and then in the LDS version it has been finalized we just mark the potential for the user to confirm.
