 Represents the relationship between an individual currently serving in a position, as well as a possible replacement candidate to a Position. Most fields are optional since you could have just a proposed calling, in which case it would not have a CDOL ID, or any combination of current or proposed individual ID's, as well as even the status which would likely be the case for a calling that is recorded in LCR and not currently in the process of changing.
