Generally street2 will be empty, but it could be City, State Postal so we're going to check if street 2 already contains the city, state or zip then we'll just use that, otherwise we'll add an address element that is made up of the combination of city, state, zip.
                // The reason we do this is to maintain flexibility between lds.org endpoints. Our current fallback endpoint doesn't have a city field, it has a desc1, desc2 and potentially a desc3. In most cases desc1 is the street1 and desc2 is city, state zip, but not always. But there isn't a discrete city field that we can store. So addresses have to be essentially for display only, we can't use city as a filter, or do anything intelligent with the discrete parts
