We don't necessarily know if street[0] is the number and street (though it usually will be), or if city, state are in street[1] or street[2]. We just display whatever is in the array as a convenience for the user. There are 2 reasons for this. 1 is that we don't have a use case or any need to do anything based on city or state, it's just for display. 2 is that depending on the service that we're pulling data from lds.org the data may just be generic strings. In the case of pulling data from HTVT we do have dedicated city, state fields, but if we have to fall back to ldstools/directory then it just comes as strings. So the model will support the lowest common denominator. */
