 An Org represents a CDOL org or sub org. In most cases a unit level org (i.e. EQ, RS, Primary, etc.) does not have callings associated directly with it. The callings will be in a sub org. So Primary Teachers are assigned to a specific class, that is an Org in the children of Primary. The Bishopric is the only exception we've found to this rule, there are no children for the bishopric org, it just has callings.

Since an Org represents both types of structures we decided to just use the int, and then in the cases where it's appropriate and necessary we can retrieve the corresponding UnitLevelOrgType for a given orgTypeId
