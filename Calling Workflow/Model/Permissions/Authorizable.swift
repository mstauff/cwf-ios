/** Protocol for defining target objects that can be used to verify if a user is authorized to act on the data. For example, a EQ Pres (OrgAdmin) has permissions to view and edit data, but only within his org, not within the primary. A Bishop would be authorized to create or edit the google drive settings but only for his ward. So for any object that needs to be analyzed to ensure that the user has rights to view it we can create an Authorizable representation of that object with the data that is needed to be able to verify whether a user has access. The PermissionManager.isAuthorized() and PermissionResolver.isAuthorized() methods all take an Authorizable targetData parameter.
 
 The most basic case is at the very least we need to verify that the data is for the users unit, so having a unit number is the only required method of the interface, but other objects (like an AuthorizableOrg) need more than just a unit number so other instances have their own data that is specific to what they need to verify user access.

    // This is the org type of the root org. So it may be that the org the user is trying to edit is the EQ Instructors, but this org type would be that of the root org (EQ)
    let unitLevelOrgType : UnitLevelOrgType
    // This is the orgType of the actual org that is being verified. We don't have an enum for every possible sub org type (i.e. EQ Instructors), we only make an enum for the main root level org types (HP, EQ, RS, etc.). So that's why we use the enum for the unitLevelOrgType, but just the orgTypeId for the actual org. This is primarily used to verify if it's a sub-org that may be an exception to the users privileges. Most orgs presidencies have rights to view their org, but they have an exception for the presidency org (so if a bishop is making changes to the primary presidency, the presidency members won't see it through the app when they shouldn't be privy to that information). So this id is necessary to know if an org that someone has rights to via their rights to the unit level org may not have rights to the presidency sub-org.
