 Represents a specific Position, so Bishop, Primary Teacher, etc. It does not know anything about the person holding it, it is just the representation of the actual Position. All fields are required as there's not really a logical state where a field might not be populated or known. This is essentially a finite set of enums, we just don't make it an enum in our code so we don't have to duplicate everything that exists in the CDOL enums for positions.

     In LCR you can't remove some positions, but you can hide them if you want. I'm not sure the use case, but maybe in a situation where you don't have an EQ secretary, and don't plan to fill it you might want to hide the position rather than just leaving it blank. Also, if you have a class with multiple teachers, when there are more than one you can remove the extra teachers (actually remove the position, not just release the teacher), but once you are down to one the last one cannot be removed it can only be hidden.
